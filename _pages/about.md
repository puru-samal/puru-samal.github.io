Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m Puru, currently pursuing a joint Master's degree on a fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University, where I work across the Schools of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Music. My academic and research interests span the fields of Computer Systems, Machine Learning, and Digital Signal Processing. While I’m fascinated by all of these areas, I have a particular focus on Audio Signal Processing, Music Information Retrieval, Sound Synthesis/Generation, Performance Modeling, and Real-Time Audio Systems.

Outside of my academic pursuits, you can often find me shooting hoops, [creating music with everyday objects](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvAiR4lyi3mZD7nfLja-NN_DJQRzc_KpW&si=0O77zlznqzjQPh4t) (because everything can be an instrument!), or exploring diverse cuisines with my partner, Caitlin. I also enjoy delving into challenging books and research papers, relishing the ongoing process of learning and occasionally marveling at how much more there is to discover.
